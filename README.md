A Modification of [Brent's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent%27s_method#Brent's_method), implemented in MATLAB. 

Brent's method is a numerical algorithm for finding function roots efficiently (with superlinear convergence). This implements the algorithm outlined in a paper published in 2013 in the journal Numerische Mathematik by Ming Gu and Gautam Wikins.
